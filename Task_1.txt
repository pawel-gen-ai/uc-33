pyspark code to create data frame base on sql query, table is dataframe 

ChatGPT
Certainly! If you have a DataFrame in PySpark and you'd like to create a new DataFrame based on an SQL query, you'll first need to register your DataFrame as a temporary SQL view and then use Spark's SQL context to run your query.

Here's how you can do it:

Start with setting up your PySpark environment:
python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("SQL Query on DataFrame") \
    .getOrCreate()
Create a sample DataFrame:
python
Copy code
data = [("John", 28, "Male"), ("Amy", 24, "Female"), ("Mike", 30, "Male")]
columns = ["Name", "Age", "Gender"]

df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=columns)
Register the DataFrame as a temporary SQL view:
python
Copy code
df.createOrReplaceTempView("people")
Now you can use SQL queries to generate new DataFrames:
python
Copy code
result_df = spark.sql("SELECT Name, Age FROM people WHERE Gender = 'Male'")

result_df.show()
This will produce:

diff
Copy code
+-----+---+
| Name|Age|
+-----+---+
| John| 28|
| Mike| 30|
+-----+---+
You can modify the SQL query in the spark.sql() function to whatever SQL statement you'd like to use.
